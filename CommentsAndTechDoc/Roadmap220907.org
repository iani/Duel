Several times the =newGame= command failed to execute on the remote partner's computer.
To remedy this:

- Add a simple chat scheme as a way to communicate while live coding within a session.
- Add a way for a partner to request the resending of a code.

 Alternatively:

 The remote partner can execute the new game command locally - after it has been confirmed with the other partner via chat.

* Chat and local code window

** Basic version
The window has the title (name) "Chat".
It has the following text input fields, with the following labels displayed through StaticText, explaining their function:

1. Send: [send the text in the input field to all partners via OscGroups]
2. Received: [Display the text received from another partner]
3. Run locally: [Evaluate the code from the field locally].
