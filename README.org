* Installation

1. Clone this repository inside your =Platform.userExtensionsDir=.
2. Clone (or pull latest version of) sc-hacks-redux inside your =Platform.userExtensionsDir=.
3. Recompile the SuperCollider class library.

* Example
To run a script stored in the same folder as Duel.sc,
send the Duel class a message whose name corresponds to the name of the
file of the script, without the scd.  For example:

#+begin_src sclang
Duel.test
#+end_src

loads the script:

#+begin_src sclang
test.scd
#+end_src
* Playing the Duel game simulation.

Run this at the beginning to initialize some variables and start the server:
#+begin_src sclang
Duel.initialize;
#+end_src

Run this to create a new game

#+begin_src sclang
Duel.newgame
#+end_src

Then play the game (see other code for that ...)
Every time the game ends, run =Duel.newgame= again.
